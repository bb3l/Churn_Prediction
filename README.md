The data was downloaded from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers.

It is fictional data about a bank and its customers and whether they churned ('Exited') or not. Churning is when a customer stops using product or services provide by a company, so basically, it is when companies lose customers.

'Exited' is the target variable. You would want to build a model that will predict whether a potential customer will churn or not. If 'Exited'=1 , that is yes, which means that the customer churned. If it is 0, it means the customer did not churn.

After that, the model was deployed locally using flask.

This is what it looks like:
